## Game written for Motorola Academy programing task

Hi my name is Anna, I learnt to program years ago, but never started professional career as software developer. After big change in my life I decided to switch my career path and back to programming.

I like to code, its challenging, often frustrating but gives huge satisfaction when things start working as you expected.
Over the years I used many languages, currently I best know Python.
